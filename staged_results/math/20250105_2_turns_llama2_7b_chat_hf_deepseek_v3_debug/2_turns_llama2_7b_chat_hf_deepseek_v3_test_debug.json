        " Great, let's solve this problem step-by-step!\n\nStep 1: To find the number of ways to choose a president, we need to find the number of ways to choose 10 individuals from a group of 20. There are $20 \\div 10 = 2$ ways to choose 10 individuals from a group of 20.\n\nStep 2: To find the number of ways to choose a vice-president, we need to find the number of ways to choose 10 individuals from the remaining 10 members of the club (i.e., the 10 boys and the 10 girls). There are also $20 \\div 10 = 2$ ways to choose 10 individuals from a group of 10.\n\nStep 3: Since we have no restrictions other than the same person can't hold both offices, we can choose the same person to be both president and vice-president. Therefore, the total number of ways to choose a president and a vice-president is the product of the number of ways to choose a president and the number of ways to choose a vice-president: $2 \\times 2 = 4$ ways.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $4$ ways to choose a president and a vice-president if we have no restrictions other than the same person can't hold both offices.\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{4}",
        "Apologies for the confusion earlier! Let's carefully solve this problem step-by-step.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the problem\nWe have 20 members in the club (10 boys and 10 girls). We need to choose a president and a vice-president, with the restriction that the same person cannot hold both offices. The genders of the members do not matter in this problem.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Choosing the president\nThere are **20 members** in the club, and any one of them can be chosen as the president. So, there are **20 possible choices** for the president.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Choosing the vice-president\nOnce the president has been chosen, there are **19 members left** (since the same person cannot hold both offices). So, there are **19 possible choices** for the vice-president.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Total number of ways\nThe total number of ways to choose a president and a vice-president is the product of the number of choices for president and the number of choices for vice-president. This is because each choice of president can be paired with any of the 19 choices for vice-president.\n\nThus, the total number of ways is:\n\\[\n20 \\times 19 = 380\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\nThere are **380 ways** to choose a president and a vice-president under the given restrictions.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{380}\n\\]"

Step 2: Out of the 60 students in the drama club, 36 take mathematics and 27 take physics, and 20 students take both mathematics and physics. Step 3: To calculate the number of students taking only math, we subtract the number of students taking both from the total taking math: $36 - 20 = 16$. Step 4: Similarly, to calculate the number of students taking only physics, we subtract the number of students taking both from the total taking physics: $27 - 20 = 7$. Step 5: Now, to find the number of students taking neither math nor physics, we subtract the total number of students taking only math, only physics, and both from the total number of students in the drama club. This gives us $60 - 16 - 7 - 20 = \\boxed{17}$ students taking neither. Answer: \\boxed{17}"
