        " Great, let's start solving the next problem!\n\nThe given square quilt block is made up of nine unit squares, some of which have been divided into triangles by cutting them in half. To find the fraction of the square quilt that is shaded, we need to count the number of shaded unit squares and divide it by the total number of unit squares.\n\nSo, we need to find the number of shaded unit squares in the quilt block. To do this, we can count the number of triangles in the quilt block and multiply it by the area of each triangle.\n\nThe quilt block has 9 unit squares, and each unit square is divided into 2 triangles. So, the total number of triangles in the quilt block is 9 x 2 = 18 triangles.\n\nThe area of each triangle is half the area of the unit square, which is $1/4$ of the square. So, the area of each shaded triangle is $1/4$.\n\nNow, we can multiply the number of shaded triangles by the area of each triangle to find the total shaded area:\n\n$18 \\times 1/4 = 4.5$\n\nSo, the fraction of the square quilt that is shaded is $4.5/9 = 15/8$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $15/8$.",
