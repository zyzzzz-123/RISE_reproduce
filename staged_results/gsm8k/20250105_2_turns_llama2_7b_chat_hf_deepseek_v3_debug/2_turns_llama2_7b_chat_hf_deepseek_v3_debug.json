Step 2: Today, Julie read twice as many pages as yesterday, so she read 2 \\* 12 = 24 pages. Step 3: Now, to find out how many pages Julie has left to read, we need to subtract the number of pages she read today from the total number of pages in the book: $120 - 24 = 96$ pages. Step 4: To find out how many pages Julie should read tomorrow to read half of the remaining pages, we can use the following formula: $half \\* total = \\boxed{pages}$ $half = \\frac{remaining}{2}$ $pages = \\frac{96}{2} = \\boxed{48}$ Step 5: So, Julie should read 48 pages tomorrow to read half of the remaining pages. Answer: $\\boxed{48}$."
