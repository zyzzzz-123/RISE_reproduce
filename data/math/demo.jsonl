{"problem": "The square quilt block shown is made from nine unit squares, some of which have been divided in half to form triangles. What fraction of the square quilt is shaded? Express your answer as a common fraction.\n\n[asy]size(75);\nfill(scale(3)*unitsquare,gray(.6));\npath[] interior = (1,0)--(0,1)--(1,1)--cycle^^(1,1)--(2,1)--(2,2)--(1,2)--cycle^^(1,2)--(0,2)--(1,3)--cycle^^(2,1)--(2,0)--(3,1)--cycle^^(2,2)--(2,3)--(3,2)--cycle;\nclip(interior);\ndraw(interior);\ndraw(scale(3)*unitsquare);\n[/asy]", "level": "Level 2", "type": "Prealgebra", "solution": "We can slide the triangles without changing their shape or area until one row of squares is shaded.  This shaded row is one of the three rows of squares in the figure.  Thus, the shaded area is $\\boxed{\\frac13}$ of the area of the quilt."}
{"problem": "A company that sells widgets has to pay $\\$500$ in maintenance fees each day and then it pays each worker $\\$15$ per hour. Each worker makes 5 widgets per hour, which are sold at $\\$3.10$ each. What is the least number of workers the company has to hire in order to make a profit in an 8-hour workday?", "level": "Level 5", "type": "Prealgebra", "solution": "We look for the least number of workers $n$ such that the cost is less than the revenue in a day of work. The cost of each worker is $\\$15$ per hour, while the revenue that comes from each worker hired is $\\$3.10\\times5$ widgets per hour. \\begin{align*}\n500+8(15n)&<(8)(3.1)(5)n=124n\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n500+120n&<124n\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n500&<4n\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n125&<n.\n\\end{align*}The smallest integer greater than 125 is 126, so the company has to hire at least $\\boxed{126}$ workers to make a profit."}
{"problem": "Rounded to 2 decimal places, what is $\\frac{7}{9}$?", "level": "Level 4", "type": "Prealgebra", "solution": "Calculating, $\\frac{7}{9}=7\\div 9=0.7777\\cdots=0.\\overline{7}$.  Rounded to 2 decimal places, $\\frac{7}{9}$ is $\\boxed{0.78}$."}
{"problem": "At the end of the day, a bakery had $\\frac{6}{7}$ of a pie left over. Louie, Duey and Huey split the pie, with each taking home the same amount of leftover pie. How much pie did Louie take home?", "level": "Level 3", "type": "Prealgebra", "solution": "Since there are $3$ people who took home pieces of $\\frac{6}{7}$ of a pie, we must divide $\\frac{6}{7}$ by $3$. \\[\n\\frac{6}{7} \\div 3 = \\frac{6}{7} \\div \\frac{3}{1} = \\frac{6}{7} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{6 \\cdot 1}{7 \\cdot 3} = \\frac{6}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{7} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{7} = \\frac{2}{7}.\n\\] Therefore Louie, Duey, and Huey each took home $\\frac{2}{7}$ of a pie, and as such, Louie took home $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{7}}\\text{ of a pie}$."}
{"problem": "The local theater has one ticket window. In how many ways can six people line up to buy a ticket?", "level": "Level 2", "type": "Prealgebra", "solution": "We must count the number of permutations of 6 people.  There are 6 choices for the first person in line, 5 choices for the second person in line, etc.  So the answer is $6\\cdot5\\cdot 4\\cdot 3\\cdot2\\cdot 1=\\boxed{720}$."}
